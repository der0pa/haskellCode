{-

'lambda calculus' or more specific 'typed lambda calculus' is the foundation of the Haskell programming language.

f(x) = x + 1      this function named f takes on argument named x
                  and adds one to it.

                  so if 2 is passed in for x
f(2) = 2 + 1      

-}

addOne x =
  x + 1

-- the argument (x) is a placeholder for a value

{-

the lambda symbol in haskell is written as a backslash as in:    \

the function has no name - it is a anonymous or unnamed function.

this is what is called the identity function:    \x.x
the dot separates the 'function head' from the 'function body'
